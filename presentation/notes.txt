Points for presentation on Friday (17/11/23):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Week #1 : (9/10/23 to 13/10/23)
- Did tutorials.
- Learnt how to plot t-SNE plots.

------ Start presentation from here ----------------------------------------------------------

Week #2: (16/10/23 to 20/10/23)
- Obtained feature maps for DUCKnet.
- Plotted instance-wise t-SNE for every DUCKnet layer.
- Plotted voxel-wise t-SNE for every DUCKnet layer.
    As the number of voxels was very high, I couldn't take
    all the voxels at once. I had to dilate the ground truth
    and subtract the ground truth from the dilated mask to
    get a 'ring' of negative voxels around the ground truth.

Week #3: (23/10/23 to 27/10/23)
- Started implementing Supervised Contrastive Loss.
    I began with first implementing the loss using for loops
    to ensure that the formulae I'd written were correct. I
    later vectorized the loss function to make it more efficient.
    Also, the formula was changed a little bit.
- Implemented a training and validation loop using this Supervised
  Contrastive Loss to classify instances as anomalous or normal.
    For this scenario, there weren't enough samples for the model
    to really learn anything.

Week #4: (30/10/23 to 04/11/23)
- Implemented a patch-level training and valiation loop using the
  previously written Supervised Contrastive Loss.
    I had to first write a script to split the dataset into a patch
    dataset, as I wasn't able to load the entire datset as patches
    while training and then, I labelled the patches as anomalous or
    normal. The results of this experiment were much better than the
    instance level experiment, as there were more 'samples' to train
    the model on. The feature separability of the encoder outputs was
    also much better as visualized on with a t-SNE plot.
- Uptil now, a VGG16 encoder was being used, so I implemented a ResNet18
  encoder.

Week #5: (06/11/23 to 10/11/23)

Week #6: (13/11/23 to 17/11/23)

I should have notes in my journal for everything I've done beyond this point.

Things I need for the presentation: 
- Feature maps for DUCKnet // required?
- Instance-wise t-SNE for DUCKnet // required?
- 'ring' dilated-subtracted ground truth for negative DUCKnet voxels // done
- Supervised Contrastive Loss formula
- t-SNE for instance-wise Supervised Contrastive Loss VGG16 // just have to run
- t-SNE for patch-wise Supervised Contrastive Loss VGG16 // done
- will need more things

Get the story straight: 
- I started work with first plotting the activation layers for the DUCKnet implemented by Ramanujam, and then moved onto
